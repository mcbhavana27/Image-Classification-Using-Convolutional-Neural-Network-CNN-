## Dataset

 CIFAR-10 dataset was developed along with the CIFAR-100 dataset by researchers at the CIFAR institute.

The dataset is comprised of 60,000 32Ã—32 pixel color photographs of objects from 10 classes, such as frogs, birds, cats, ships, etc. The class labels and their standard associated integer values are listed below.

    0: airplane
    1: automobile
    2: bird
    3: cat
    4: deer
    5: dog
    6: frog
    7: horse
    8: ship
    9: truck

These are very small images, much smaller than a typical photograph, and the dataset was intended for computer vision research.

## Define Model

Next, we need a way to a neural network model.

The define_model() function below will define and return this model and can be filled-in or replaced for a given model configuration that we wish to evaluate later.
	
# define cnn model
def define_model():
	model = Sequential()
	# ...
	return model
  
 ## Evaluate Model

After the model is defined, we need to fit and evaluate it.
